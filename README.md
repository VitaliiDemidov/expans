this is simple Expance meneger,
you can add expanses,
sort by date,
delete,
and using total button you can convert your amount expances into EURO (by up to date rates)
there is an issue with Fixer API wich i'm using here.
unfortunately it doesn't support https on free account and that is cause an error when deployed
